## Installation

gem 'polyhedral'
```

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install polyhedral

## Usage

`3.d6+4` to roll a six-sided die three times and add 4 to the total

`4.d6.drop_lowest` to roll four six-sided dice and add together the best three.

`1.d20.with_advantage` to roll two d20 and keep the best one

`Polyhedral::Die.d20.with_advantage` will manage the same thing

`1.d20.with_disadvantage` to roll two d20 and keep the crappy one

`Polyhedral::Die.d20.with_disadvantage` will manage the same thing

`%w{str dex con int wis cha}.map {|attr| [attr, 4.d6.drop_lowest]}.to_h` will give you your starting character ability scores
